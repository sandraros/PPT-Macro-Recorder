# PPT-VBA-pseudo-recorder
Generate PowerPoint VBA corresponding to current selection

There's no macro recorder in PowerPoint since version 2007 or 2010 (?)

# How to use it
Select any element in your PowerPoint presentation, run the macro, and it will create a file on your laptop containing the VBA code to generate the element.
